//! The in-process job runner that replaces Resque (see plans/rust-conversion.md, "Jobs").
//!
//! Models emit [`Event`]s at the point Rails would `perform_later` (the database's
//! [`EventSink`]); [`Jobs`] puts each on its kind's **bounded** queue without blocking the writer
//! thread, and each kind has its own workers, so a kind that's slow (webhooks to a slow bot) or
//! full can't hold up the others (pushes, purges). Nothing retries (`retry_on` is commented out
//! in `reference/app/jobs/application_job.rb`); a failure or panic is logged. Queued work is lost
//! if the process crashes, which the plan accepts. On shutdown the runner stops taking new work,
//! performs what's queued and waits for it up to a deadline.
//!
//! Handlers are looked up in a [`Registry`]. Core registers `RemoveBannedContent` and
//! `PurgeBlob`; integrations register `PushMessage` and `DeliverWebhook` through
//! `crate::integrations::register_jobs`. `DisconnectUser` is not a job in Rails (it's a
//! synchronous Action Cable broadcast), so it goes straight to the cable server.
