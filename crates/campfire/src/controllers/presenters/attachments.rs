//! `has_one_attached` as `User::Avatar` (`:avatar`) and `Account` (`:logo`) use it, over
//! `campfire_storage` (reference/app/models/user/avatar.rb, account.rb, and Active Storage's
//! `Attached::Changes::CreateOne` / `Attachment`).
//!
//! Assigning an uploaded file and saving the record, in the record's transaction:
//! the old attachment is destroyed first (`has_one ... dependent: :destroy` replacing its target;
//! its blob is purged after commit, `dependent: :purge_later`), then the new blob and attachment
//! rows are inserted, and each attachment change touches the record
//! (`belongs_to :record, touch: true`). Since a fresh blob isn't analyzed, `ActiveStorage::AnalyzeJob`
//! runs after commit (analysis touches the record again).
//!
//! Unlike Rails, which uploads after commit, the file is uploaded before the transaction
//! ([`Assignment::stage`]), so the writer never waits on copying and checksumming it; a
//! transaction that rolls back deletes it again.
